# Degen Token (ERC-20) on Avalanche: Unlocking the Future of Gaming ðŸŽ®

## Description

Degen Token is an ERC-20 token designed to revolutionize the gaming industry. Developed in collaboration with Degen Gaming, this token aims to reward players in-game and increase player loyalty and retention. Built on the Avalanche blockchain, the token promises fast transactions with low fees, making it ideal for web3 gaming projects.

## Challenge

The contract should provide the following functionalities:

- **Minting Tokens**: Only the owner should be able to mint new tokens.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Players can transfer their tokens to other addresses.
- **Redeeming Tokens**: Tokens can be redeemed for in-game items.
- **Checking Token Balance**: Players can view their token balance.
- **Burning Tokens**: Tokens can be burned by the owner, reducing the total supply.

## Tools Used

- Computer
- NodeJS
- Hardhat
- Solidity
